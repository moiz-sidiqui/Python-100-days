# PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that outlines the style guide
# for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code. It provides conventions
#  for formatting Python code, such as how to name variables and functions, how to 
# structure code blocks, and how to use whitespace. Following PEP 8 helps make your 
# code more readable and maintainable, especially when collaborating with others.

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. 
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.    
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.      
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
